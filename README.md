*Add more services to Jetpack Sharing*

## Description

[Jetpack](http://jetpack.me) is awesome! It's used globally. But they can't cover all services. For example, "[LINE](http://line.me)".
This supplies additional Jetpack sharing sources for your website.

Currently, we support the following sources:

* [feedly](https://feedly.com/) (Since 0.1.0)
* [LINE](http://line.me) (Since 0.1.2)
* [Hatena](http://b.hatena.ne.jp/) (Since 0.1.2)
* [Instapaper](https://www.instapaper.com/) (Since 0.1.2)
* [Delicious](http://delicious.com/) (Since 0.1.2)

Any suggestion to add new service is welcome! Please let me know from [here](https://www.extendwings.com/contact/).
